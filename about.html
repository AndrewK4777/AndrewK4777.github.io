				<h2>What is a WondewStraw?</h2>
				<p>A WonderStraw is a straw that is 6 inches in diameter, and 4 feet in length that functions as an alternative to drinking out of a glass. It is made out of plastic, and is packaged in a form fitting plastic container, sold in packs of 3 or 10. The straw will also feature a bendable tip that smaller counterparts feature</p>

				<h2>What is the timeline?</h2>
				<p>We are hoping to have our initial run contracted and in action by mid-summer. We are currently in talks with our factory producer in China, as well as some markets to reserve shelf space. Multiple chains have expressed interest, and many more are waiting for the results of our test run.</p>
